## Approach

**Reasons we went with this particular tech stack.**w

- **React**: 
    - Fast & Easy at building interactive UI, because itâ€™s declarative
    - Easier to hire react dev and onboard them with the codebase.
    - Reusable components, easier to maintain, and is flexible due to their modular structure
    - Fast rendering, React is built to have high performance (virtual DOM program and server-side rendering)
- **TypeScript** is a statically compiled programming language for writing clear and concise JavaScript code and it supports both dynamic and static typing. 
    - Static Typing, easier to read and debug, avoid hidden errors (ex: undefined)
    - Increases dev team confidence when refactoring the code or scaling the project fast.
    - Relying on a specific structure is a much safer solution
- **CSS**
    - Project was light and it makes more sense to write custom classes then Importing an entire library for such a small styling.
